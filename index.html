I am a Portland-based student at <strong><a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a></strong> focusing my studies on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and React. I have a diverse background and have enjoyed careers in many different fields such as Human Resources, Veterinary Medicine, and Hospitality.

    <h2 class="heading">What I Dig</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>History. Especially if it has to do with the World Wars or the Middle East.</li>
      <li>Documentaries. About anything!</li>
      <li>Diving into a good podcast or book. Any recommendations?</li>
      <li>Making and listening to music of all kinds. Collab?</li>
      <li>Animal rescue. Watch out for all the dog hair, sorry!</li>
      <li>Weird art, photography, and art history. Think George Condo and John Paul Fauves.</li>
      <li>Social justice. <em><strong><span class="blm">Black Lives Matter.</strong></em></span></li>
    </ul>
