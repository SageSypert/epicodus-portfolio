  <h2>Allow Me to Introduce Myself</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Sage. I am a Portland-based student at Epicodus focusing my studies on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and React. I have a diverse background and have enjoyed careers in many different fields such as Human Resources, Veterinary Medicine, and Hospitality. Innovation and continuous learning are my passions in life and I look forward to thriving in the tech industry and helping make the web a beautiful place.</p>
  
  <h2>What I Dig</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>History. Especially if it has to do with the World Wars or the Middle East.</li>
    <li>Documentaries. About anything!</li>
    <li>Diving into a good podcast or book. Any recommendations?</li>
    <li>Making and listening to music of all kinds. Collab?</li>
    <li>Animal rescue. Watch out for all the dog hair, sorry!</li>
    <li>Weird art, photography, and art history. Think George Condo and John Paul Fauves.</li>
    <li>Social justice. Black Lives Matter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Work</h2>
  <p>Here is a list of what I have been working on with Epicodus so far:</p>
